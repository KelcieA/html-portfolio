<h1>The Best Movies According to Kelcie</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Nightmare Before Christmas</h3>
<p>It can be considered both a Halloween and Christmas movie. It also has amazing music and dynamic characters.</p>
<h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p>It has some of the most beautiful scenery and costumes. The storyline is similar to love stories that happen in current times. And I love that when they speak it sounds like poetry.</p>
<h3>My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2</h3>
<p>This movie is so heart warming and is there when I need to smile. It shows a different culture, while offering romance and laughter. Not to mention it reminds women that we have a purpose outside of being wives and mothers.</p>
