<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone! My name is Kelcie Aders and I am a full stack web developer. I started my journey after my son was born and I knew I wanted to give him a better life while following a passion of mine.
  I have experience in the programing languages HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I love to learn new things and my B.S. in Anthropology allows me to look at projects in a unique way.
  I have also studied cyber security to make the projects I make more secure, and make my clients feel safer. I look forward to working with you in a team effort to make desirable and successful projects.
  If you would like to contact me my information can be found bellow.
